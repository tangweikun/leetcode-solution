- `getElementById` to get a element that has the provided Id.
- `getElementsByClassName` to get a nodelist (nodelist is not an array, rather it is array-like object) by providing a class name.
- `getElementsByTagName` to get a nodelist by the provided tag name.
- `querySelector` you will pass css style selector (jquery style) and this will return first matched element in the DOM.
- `querySelectorAll` will return a non-live nodelist by using depth-first pre order traversal of all the matched elements. Non-live means, any changes after selecting the elements will not be reflected.
